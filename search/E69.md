# E69. Sqrt(x)
# Intuition
For xâ‰¥2x the square root is always smaller than x/2 and larger than 0 : 0<a<x/2.
Since a is an integer, the problem goes down to the iteration over the sorted set of integer numbers. Here the binary search enters the scene.

# Approach
If x < 2, return x.

Set the left boundary to 2, and the right boundary to x / 2.

While left <= right:

Take num = (left + right) / 2 as a guess. Compute num * num and compare it with x:

If num * num > x, move the right boundary right = pivot -1

Else, if num * num < x, move the left boundary left = pivot + 1

Otherwise num * num == x, the integer square root is here, let's return it

Return right

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(log n)

- Space complexity: O(1)

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if(x < 2) return x;

        int pivot, l = 2, r = (x/2);

        while(l<=r) {
            pivot = l+(r-l) / 2;
            long num = (long) pivot*pivot;
            if(num < x) l = pivot+1;
            else if(num > x) r = pivot-1;
            else return pivot;
        }

        return r;
    }
}
```
