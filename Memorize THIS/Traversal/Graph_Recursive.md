Graph traversal involves visiting all nodes or vertices of a graph in a specific manner. The two most common types of graph traversal techniques are Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here, we will focus on recursive versions of these traversals.

### Graph Representation
Before diving into the traversals, let's use an adjacency list representation for the graph, which is commonly used because of its efficiency in terms of space:

```java
import java.util.*;

// Graph class with adjacency list representation
class Graph {
	private final Map<Integer, List<Integer>> adjList = new HashMap<>();

	// Method to add an edge in the graph
	public void addEdge(int src, int dest) {
		adjList.computeIfAbsent(src, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(dest);
		adjList.computeIfAbsent(dest, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(src); // For undirected graph
	}

	public List<Integer> getAdjVertices(int vertex) {
		return adjList.getOrDefault(vertex, new ArrayList<>());
	}
}
```

### 1. Depth-First Search (DFS) - Recursive
DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backing up. It uses recursion to explore the depth of each path.

**Recursive DFS Implementation:**

```java
class GraphTraversal {

	// Recursive DFS method
	public void recursiveDFS(int vertex, Set<Integer> visited, Graph graph) {
		// Mark the current node as visited
		visited.add(vertex);
		System.out.print(vertex + " ");

		// Recur for all the vertices adjacent to this vertex
		for (int neighbor : graph.getAdjVertices(vertex)) {
			if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
				recursiveDFS(neighbor, visited, graph);
			}
		}
	}
}

// Example usage
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Graph graph = new Graph();
		graph.addEdge(0, 1);
		graph.addEdge(0, 2);
		graph.addEdge(1, 2);
		graph.addEdge(2, 3);
		graph.addEdge(3, 4);

		GraphTraversal traversal = new GraphTraversal();
		Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
		System.out.print("DFS Recursive: ");
		traversal.recursiveDFS(0, visited, graph);
	}
}
```

### 2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) - Recursive
BFS is usually implemented iteratively with a queue, but it can also be done recursively using additional helper methods. BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. Hereâ€™s a recursive approach that mimics BFS.

**Recursive BFS Implementation:**

BFS recursion is non-trivial and often simulated using helper functions. We can achieve this by processing nodes level-by-level using recursive calls.

```java
class GraphTraversal {

	// Recursive BFS Helper Method
	private void bfsHelper(Queue<Integer> queue, Set<Integer> visited, Graph graph) {
		if (queue.isEmpty()) {
			return;
		}

		int vertex = queue.poll();
		System.out.print(vertex + " ");

		// Process all unvisited adjacent nodes
		for (int neighbor : graph.getAdjVertices(vertex)) {
			if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
				visited.add(neighbor);
				queue.add(neighbor);
			}
		}

		// Recursive call to process the next node in the queue
		bfsHelper(queue, visited, graph);
	}

	// Method to initiate recursive BFS traversal
	public void recursiveBFS(int startVertex, Graph graph) {
		Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
		Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

		visited.add(startVertex);
		queue.add(startVertex);
		bfsHelper(queue, visited, graph);
	}
}

// Example usage
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Graph graph = new Graph();
		graph.addEdge(0, 1);
		graph.addEdge(0, 2);
		graph.addEdge(1, 2);
		graph.addEdge(2, 3);
		graph.addEdge(3, 4);

		GraphTraversal traversal = new GraphTraversal();
		System.out.print("BFS Recursive: ");
		traversal.recursiveBFS(0, graph);
	}
}
```

### Summary
- **DFS Recursive:** Easy to implement, explores deep paths before backtracking.
- **BFS Recursive:** Less common recursively; usually simulated using helper functions for level-wise traversal.

Here's the time complexity analysis for the recursive versions of Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS):

### 1. Depth-First Search (DFS) - Recursive

**Time Complexity:** 
- **O(V + E)**, where:
  - **V** is the number of vertices.
  - **E** is the number of edges.

**Explanation:** 
- Each vertex is visited exactly once.
- Each edge is traversed once when checking adjacent nodes.

### 2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) - Recursive

**Time Complexity:** 
- **O(V + E)**, where:
  - **V** is the number of vertices.
  - **E** is the number of edges.

**Explanation:** 
- Similar to DFS, BFS visits each vertex and traverses each edge once.
- The recursive version has a queue structure simulated through helper recursion, still adhering to the O(V + E) complexity.

### Detailed Complexity Breakdown for Both Traversals

- **Vertex Visits:** Each vertex is added to the visited set exactly once (`O(V)`).
- **Edge Traversals:** Each edge is considered exactly once (`O(E)`), assuming an undirected graph where each edge counts once.
- **Adjacency List Access:** Accessing the adjacency list for each vertex is efficient, usually considered constant time `O(1)` for each lookup but repeated across edges.

### Summary of Complexity:
- Both DFS and BFS, whether implemented iteratively or recursively, have the same time complexity of **O(V + E)**.
- They efficiently explore all nodes and connections in the graph, making them suitable for most graph traversal tasks.
