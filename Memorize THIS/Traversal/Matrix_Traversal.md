The provided Java code contains two traversal methods, `dfs` and `bfs`, for navigating through a grid or matrix using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), respectively. Below is a detailed explanation of each section of the code, with comments:

```java
import java.util.*;

// Main class for matrix traversal
public class MatrixTraversal {

	// Depth-First Search (DFS) method
	void dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j, boolean[][] visited) {
		// Base condition to stop recursion:
		// - If the indices are out of bounds (negative or beyond grid size)
		// - If the current cell is already visited
		if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.length || j >= grid[0].length || visited[i][j])
			return;

		// Mark the current cell as visited
		visited[i][j] = true;

		// Recursively call DFS for the four possible directions: 
		// down, up, right, and left
		dfs(grid, i + 1, j, visited); // Down
		dfs(grid, i - 1, j, visited); // Up
		dfs(grid, i, j + 1, visited); // Right
		dfs(grid, i, j - 1, visited); // Left
	}

	// Directions array used to define movement in four directions
	// Each element represents movement [row change, column change]
	int[][] dirs = { { 0, 1 }, { 0, -1 }, { 1, 0 }, { -1, 0 } };

	// Breadth-First Search (BFS) method
	void bfs(char[][] grid, int _i, int _j) {
		// Queue to store the next positions to visit (FIFO structure)
		Deque<int[]> q = new ArrayDeque<>();

		// Visited array to keep track of visited cells
		boolean[][] visited = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];

		// Add the starting position to the queue and mark it as visited
		q.addLast(new int[] { _i, _j });
		visited[_i][_j] = true;

		// Loop until there are no more positions to explore
		while (!q.isEmpty()) {
			// Remove the front element from the queue
			int[] cur = q.removeFirst();

			// Explore all four possible directions using the dirs array
			for (int[] dir : dirs) {
				// Calculate the new coordinates based on the current direction
				int i = cur[0] + dir[0];
				int j = cur[1] + dir[1];

				// Check boundary conditions and if the cell has been visited
				if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.length || j >= grid[0].length || visited[i][j])
					continue;

				// Mark the new position as visited
				visited[i][j] = true;

				// Add the new position to the queue for further exploration
				q.addLast(new int[] { i, j });
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **DFS Method (`dfs`)**:
   - The `dfs` method is a recursive depth-first traversal of a grid.
   - It starts from the given position `(i, j)` and recursively explores all connected cells in four possible directions (down, up, right, left).
   - It uses boundary checks and a `visited` array to avoid revisiting cells or going out of bounds.
   - The base condition (`if` statement) stops the recursion if the current position is invalid or has already been visited.
   - The recursion continues to the neighboring cells until all reachable cells are visited.

2. **Directions Array (`dirs`)**:
   - This array contains four directions for movement: right `[0, 1]`, left `[0, -1]`, down `[1, 0]`, and up `[-1, 0]`.
   - It simplifies directional movement when traversing the grid in the BFS method.

3. **BFS Method (`bfs`)**:
   - The `bfs` method performs breadth-first traversal using a queue (`Deque<int[]>`) to explore each level of the grid before moving deeper.
   - It starts from a specified position `(_i, _j)` and explores all reachable cells level-by-level using a first-in-first-out approach.
   - For each cell, it checks the four possible directions using the `dirs` array and enqueues valid, unvisited neighbors.
   - The `visited` array ensures that each cell is processed only once, preventing infinite loops and redundant checks.

### Key Points:
- **DFS** is suitable for deep exploration and is used here for recursively traversing each direction from the current cell.
- **BFS** is suitable for level-by-level exploration and uses a queue to manage nodes to visit next.
- Both methods rely on boundary checks and a `visited` array to control traversal flow and avoid revisiting nodes.
