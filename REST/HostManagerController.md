Sure! Let's break down the code step-by-step to understand its functionality and structure.

### Overview

This code defines a Spring Boot REST controller named `HostManagerController`. The purpose of this controller is to handle HTTP requests related to fetching host managers based on an application ID. It has one main endpoint, which is documented and implemented within this controller.

### Package Declaration

```java
package com.linkedin.pe.recruit.candidateevaluation.reviewCouncil.controller.api.v1;
```

This line specifies the package in which this class resides. It follows the standard Java package naming conventions and indicates a hierarchical structure related to LinkedIn's recruiting candidate evaluation system.

### Imports

```java
import com.linkedin.pe.recruit.candidateevaluation.reviewCouncil.dto.response.HostManagersDto;
import com.linkedin.pe.recruit.candidateevaluation.reviewCouncil.service.HostManagerService;
import io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations.Operation;
import java.util.UUID;
import lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
```

This block imports various classes and annotations used in the controller. These imports include DTOs, services, Swagger annotations for API documentation, UUID for unique identifiers, Lombok for logging, and Spring Boot annotations and classes for building RESTful web services.

### Class Declaration and Annotations

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1")
@Slf4j
public class HostManagerController {
```

- `@RestController`: Indicates that this class is a REST controller, meaning it will handle HTTP requests and return responses in a RESTful manner.
- `@RequestMapping("/api/v1")`: Maps all the request paths starting with `/api/v1` to this controller.
- `@Slf4j`: A Lombok annotation that provides a logger instance for logging purposes.

### Dependency Injection

```java
@Autowired
private HostManagerService hostManagerService;
```

- `@Autowired`: This annotation is used to inject the `HostManagerService` dependency into the controller. The `hostManagerService` will be used to handle the business logic for fetching host managers.

### Endpoint Definition

```java
@Operation(summary = "API to fetch host managers based on applicationId ")
@GetMapping(value ="/application/{application_id}/host_managers", produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public ResponseEntity<HostManagersDto> getHostManagersByApplicationId(@PathVariable("application_id") UUID applicationId){
```

- `@Operation(summary = "API to fetch host managers based on applicationId ")`: A Swagger annotation that provides a summary description for the API endpoint. This is used for API documentation.
- `@GetMapping(value ="/application/{application_id}/host_managers", produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)`: Maps HTTP GET requests to the specified URL pattern to this method. It also specifies that the response will be in JSON format.
- `@PathVariable("application_id") UUID applicationId`: Binds the `application_id` from the URL to the `applicationId` method parameter. It expects a UUID type for the `applicationId`.

### Method Implementation

```java
log.info("Fetching host managers for application id : {} ", applicationId);

return ResponseEntity.ok(hostManagerService.getHostManagerByApplicationId(applicationId));
```

- `log.info("Fetching host managers for application id : {} ", applicationId)`: Logs an informational message indicating that the fetching process has started for the given application ID.
- `return ResponseEntity.ok(hostManagerService.getHostManagerByApplicationId(applicationId))`: Calls the `getHostManagerByApplicationId` method of the `hostManagerService` to fetch the host managers for the given application ID and returns the result wrapped in a `ResponseEntity` with an HTTP status of 200 (OK).

### Summary

This controller provides a single endpoint to fetch host managers based on an application ID. It uses Spring Boot annotations to define the REST endpoint and handle dependency injection, while Lombok is used for logging. Swagger annotations are employed for API documentation. The controller relies on a service class (`HostManagerService`) to perform the actual business logic of retrieving the host managers.
